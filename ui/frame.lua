-- Aegis: Exchange
-- ui/frame.lua
--
-- STANDALONE custom auction window.
--
-- Aegis is its OWN top-level frame parented to UIParent — it does NOT tab onto
-- or parent to the Blizzard AuctionFrame. When the auction house opens we hide
-- the Blizzard window and show ours in its place (the approach the Aux addon
-- uses on this 1.12 client); when it closes we hide ours. The 1.12 client has
-- no taint / protected-frame system, so replacing the AH window is safe, and
-- because no Blizzard AH frame is visible there are no default widgets, holes,
-- sort headers, or backgrounds to conflict with.
--
-- Layout: BuildWindow() creates the frame, the sub-tab strip and one empty
-- panel per sub-tab, then hands each panel to its own builder —
-- BuildBuyTab / BuildSellTab / BuildAuctionsTab / BuildCraftTab /
-- BuildHistoryTab, plus the scan controls and BuildAegisSettings for the
-- "Aegis" tab. Every panel is a real tab; none are placeholders.
--
-- The one frame here that is NOT parented to our window is
-- AegisExchangeSwapButton, the "Aegis UI" button we put ON the Blizzard AH so
-- the hand-off works both ways. See HookAuctionFrame.

-- FURTHER left (see tipChk) so the boxes line up under the text above them,
-- which put their left edge outside the frame entirely. Text got away with it
-- because a glyph carries its own side bearing; a solid 1px edge texture does
-- not, so the check boxes -- and only the check boxes -- came back shaved.

-- ui.TintButton lived here. It vertex-coloured a template button's existing
-- textures so one button could stand out, and it has no work left to do: no
-- button in the addon inherits UIPanelButtonTemplate any more, so there are
-- no textures to colour. ui.SetButtonKind replaces it.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Buttons
--
-- We draw our own rather than inherit UIPanelButtonTemplate. The template's
-- warm red-brown plate is vanilla's own art and there is nothing wrong with
-- it -- ROADMAP 2l settled that explicitly -- but the design concept asks for
-- flat dark plates with a thin border, and no vanilla template produces that.
-- So the plate is a backdrop and we own all four visual states.
--
-- Two kinds, straight from the concept's stylesheet:
--   * "primary" -- the deep red plate with a gold label (.btn). ONE per area:
--     the thing the area exists to do (Search, Post, Full Scan).
--   * "quiet"   -- the dark neutral plate with a tan label (.btn-quiet).
--     Everything else. This is the common case, so it is the default.
--
-- What the template gave away for free and is hand-written below: the hover
-- and pressed plates, the 1px label nudge on press (a button that does not
-- move when clicked feels dead), and the disabled look. Note that a bare
-- CreateFrame("Button") DOES have working Enable/Disable/IsEnabled -- they
-- just have no appearance attached, which is exactly the trap that would ship
-- a button that stops responding while still looking clickable.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Borders are DARK, not warm. The concept edges both plates with #14120f --
-- near black -- and the first pass instead used a warm brown on quiet and a
-- bright red on primary, which is what made the unskinned buttons read as
-- outlined-in-brown rather than as flat plates. Under pfUI they already
-- looked right, because pfUI supplies its own dark edge; that difference
-- between the two skins was the tell.
--
-- Not literally #14120f though. The concept's panel behind these is #3c3a36,
-- lighter than the buttons, so a near-black edge makes them pop. Our panel is
-- #211F1A -- DARKER than the plates -- so the same edge would erase the
-- outline entirely. These sit a little above it: dark enough to read as the
-- concept's crisp edge, light enough to still separate a plate from the panel.
-- WHICH REFERENCE WINS, because the two disagree and this has now flipped
-- once. `design/07-buy-tab.png` styles the primary button `#5a1414` -- deep
-- red -- and 1.14.0 took its palette from there. The later "A - Default view"
-- mockup (v1.9.0) draws Search and Buyout as a warm brown-gold plate and adds
-- a PURPLE Advanced. **The mockup is newer and it wins.** Do not re-derive
-- these from the older PNG.

-- A square check box, at any size, in either skin.
--
-- Two problems this solves.
--
-- 1. A `SetBackdrop` whose edgeSize approaches the frame size renders as a
--    garbled CROSS, not a box: the two corner pieces are each edgeSize square
--    and physically cannot both fit across a 14px frame. The result rows used
--    edgeSize 8 in a 14px button. Borders here are four 1px textures, which
--    stay square at any size.
--
-- 2. pfUI reskins anything reporting `CheckButton` -- that is what turned the
--    row boxes into crosses and "Usable items" into a circle under the skin
--    while they looked correct unskinned. aegisNoSkin opts out, the same way
--    the sort headers and category rows already do.
--
-- The checked state stays the WIDGET's OWN state -- SetChecked/GetChecked are
-- deliberately NOT overridden. A CheckButton toggles itself before OnClick
-- runs, and every handler in this file is written against that (they read
-- GetChecked() inside OnClick and expect the new value). Shadowing those two
-- methods with our own flag would leave the widget's state and ours
-- disagreeing, and each of those handlers would silently read the wrong one.
-- Instead we only replace the ART: the tick is the widget's CHECKED texture,
-- so the client shows and hides it for us and it can never drift.
-- What Aegis can and cannot answer without ClassicAPI, said once.
--
-- 1.12 stores an item's level and its vendor sell price on every item and
-- displays NEITHER -- the sell-price field is populated and the engine's
-- tooltip code simply never reads it. ClassicAPI is a DLL that exposes both.
--
-- Two different sentences because they are two different situations, and
-- saying "needs ClassicAPI" of the vendor price would be untrue: that one
-- has always worked, just slowly.

-- the OTHER case: a two-edge-anchored frame reports 0 until the client lays
-- it out, and painting one row on that pass was wrong. Both behaviours are
-- correct; they are just not the same parameter, and conflating them is what
-- produced an overflowing table.)
-- WARNING -- THIS MEASURES A FRAME, AND MEASURING IS A TRAP.
--
-- GetHeight() on a frame anchored by TWO EDGES returns the height it was last
-- LAID OUT at, not its current one; the client relayouts a frame after its
-- ancestor's size changes. Restoring a saved window size and then asking a
-- two-edge-anchored scroll frame how tall it is gets the answer from the
-- window's CREATION size, forever.
--
-- That has now cost three separate bugs: the Buy table's row count (fixed by
-- ui.PanelHeightAt), the Advanced layout's widths (ui.PanelWidthAt, 1.19.2)
-- and the Saved Searches lists (ui.SavedRowsAt, 1.19.4). Each replaced a call
-- to this function with arithmetic on the WINDOW's height, which is set
-- explicitly and is therefore true the moment it is read.
--
-- THE AUDIT IS DONE AND THIS FUNCTION IS GONE. The remaining six callers --
-- Crafting, its recipe tree, Auctions, History, and the Sell tab's bag and
-- listings lists -- every one anchored its scroll frame by two corners, so
-- every one of them was carrying the fault. They derive from the window's
-- height through ui.ListRowsAt now, and there is no measuring version left to
-- reach for.
--
-- ui.RowsFor is deliberately NOT kept as a shim. A trap that four separate
-- bugs walked into does not want a convenient spelling.

-- The Buy tab follows the mockup: a checkbox, the icon and name, then Lvl,
-- Time Left, Seller, Current Bid, Buyout, Unit and % Mkt. The stack count is
-- NOT a column -- it is appended to the name as "x3", which is what the
-- mockup does and what frees the width for the four new columns.
--
-- The Crafting tab keeps the older five-column shape with its own per-row Buy
-- and Bid buttons. It is a different question ("what can I make and what does
-- it cost"), it has no room for a seller or a time left, and changing it was
-- not asked for.
-- NO SELLER COLUMN. The mockup has one; we deliberately do not -- see
-- ROADMAP 2q. `owner` is still read by the scanner, because it is what marks
-- your own auctions; only the column is gone.
--
-- The 92px that freed goes first to the gap between Lvl and Time Left, which
-- were close enough to touch ("43 Very Long" ran together), and then to the
-- three money columns.
-- The Buy results table's columns.
--
-- ONE gutter between every pair -- 10px -- rather than the 6/8/18 mix these
-- grew into. Uneven gutters are why a table reads as assembled: the eye finds
-- the rhythm and then loses it, which looks like a mistake even when every
-- column is individually fine.
--
-- And ONE alignment rule: text LEFT, amounts RIGHT, and the level CENTRED.
-- Lvl used to be right-aligned directly before a left-aligned Time Left,
-- which pushed the two columns together into the gap between them and left
-- air on the outside of both. A level is a two-digit label rather than a
-- magnitude read digit by digit, so centring it costs nothing and stops the
-- pinch.
-- `check`, `icon` and `name` all sit 4px further right than they used to. The
-- tick box was 4px from the well border's inner edge and read as sitting on
-- it; ROWPAD.l could not be raised without costing every other table row width
-- it does not have (see ROWPAD). The three move together and `name` gives the
-- 4px back, so `lvl` and everything after it are where they always were and
-- the 6px gaps between box, icon and text are unchanged.

-- straddles its own edge by half the edgeSize. Every table's well is anchored
-- to its scroll frame's right edge -- which means rows running the full width
-- of the scroll frame end up UNDER that border, and the last column with them.
-- That is one bug with two faces: the bag rows visibly poking through the box
-- edge, and the Buy table's "% Mkt" being shaved by it.
--
-- ONE table, read by every row builder and by both layout functions, because
-- the rows' inset and the width the columns are allowed to use are the same
-- measurement seen from two ends.
--
-- WHERE THE NUMBERS COME FROM. Every well draws edgeSize 12, so its border
-- reaches 6px INWARD from the frame edge it is drawn on. The two sides are not
-- anchored alike, which is why the two pads are not equal:
--
--   left   the well is offset -6 from the scroll frame, so its border's inner
--          edge lands exactly ON the scroll frame's left edge. Clearance is
--          therefore ROWPAD.l itself.
--   right  the well is FLUSH with the scroll frame (any positive offset puts
--          the box under the scrollbar), so the border reaches 6px past that
--          edge into the rows. Clearance is ROWPAD.r minus 6.
--
-- The RIGHT had 2px of real clearance and that shaved the Buy tab's
-- right-justified "% Mkt", which always ends exactly on the row's right edge
-- because the Item column absorbs every surplus pixel. It is a full border
-- width now.
--
-- The LEFT stays at 2, deliberately. Six tables read this and only one of them
-- puts a CONTROL hard against the left edge; the other five start with text,
-- which 2px already clears. Raising it costs every table 4px of row and the
-- Sell tab's bag column has none to give -- its name column is sized to
-- consume exactly what is left. The Buy tab's tick box is moved instead, in
-- RCX_BUY, where the problem actually is.

-- is exactly why every other table read as a different addon; four tabs each
-- growing their own copy instead is the shape that produced the
-- Saved-vs-Builder drift in 1.19.3.
--
-- CREATION ORDER IS THE WHOLE THING. All three are BACKGROUND textures, and
-- within one layer the draw order IS the creation order:
--   zebra     first -- bottom-most, so a selected odd row reads as selected
--                      rather than as striped-and-selected;
--   separator next  -- above the stripe, so it survives on a banded row;
--   selection last  -- so it covers the separator on the picked row instead
--                      of letting it show through as a scar.
-- Any other order is a silent visual bug: nothing errors, every row still
-- draws, and the fault is only visible to a person looking at the tab. The
-- cells are FontStrings on OVERLAY, so they sit above all three whenever they
-- are created.
--
-- The stripe is keyed to the row's POSITION IN THE POOL, never to the entry
-- it happens to be showing. Set once here and never touched by any paint,
-- which is what makes scrolling slide the data past fixed banding instead of
-- making the stripes crawl with it.

-- box is a child frame with an 85%-opaque backdrop -- so a heading built that
-- way is drawn UNDERNEATH its own table's background, comes out darkened and
-- desaturated, and reads as grey.
--
-- Which is exactly what happened: "Your Bags" and "Qty" set the identical
-- palette entry the listings headings set, and rendered a different colour,
-- because the listings headings were Buttons (child frames) and these were
-- not. No amount of correcting the colour would have fixed it -- the colour
-- was never wrong.
--
-- So both go through here now and the difference cannot come back.

-- Button, a fixed one only needs a Frame, and both are child frames.

-- Move the results table between its two origins, and give the width it gains
-- in Advanced to the Item column.

-- Only THREE things are re-anchored -- the well, the scroll frame and the

-- v1.35.0 change that taught the table to use the whole window was inert in
-- exactly the situation it was written for.

-- Do the result columns fit the row width at a window `w` wide?

-- the Seller column changed every offset after it; this is what says whether
-- the new numbers still fit rather than someone re-adding them by hand.
-- How much room the results table has, and whether what sits beneath it
-- still fits, at a window `h` tall.
--
-- The table now FILLS the height rather than stopping at a fixed fraction, so

-- above and the count/pager, rule and action bar below all still have their
-- space. Returns the usable row area, and false if the budget is blown.
-- Vertical distance from the WINDOW's height to a tab panel's height. The

-- sets the window's height and nothing repaints afterwards, so every list
