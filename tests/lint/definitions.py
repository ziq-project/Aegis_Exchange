"""Every top-level definition that existed at a git ref still exists now.

This guards against a failure that has eaten a function THREE times in this
repo: a scripted edit whose boundary search ran past the end of what it meant
to replace, deleting a neighbouring function along with the target.

It is nasty precisely because nothing else notices. The file still compiles --
Lua does not care that a function is missing until something calls it -- and
the calling code is usually in a branch the tests do not reach, so the suite
stays green and the loss surfaces in-game as "that button does nothing".

Once (v1.14.0) a DOTALL regex ate two buttons' parent arguments and every test
still passed. Once it removed MakeMoneyGSC while replacing the function above
it. Run this after ANY scripted or multi-line edit.

Usage:  python3 tests/lint/definitions.py [ref] [files...]
        ref defaults to HEAD; files default to core/ + ui/
