-- The post-filter components that narrow on data the PAGE already carries:
-- min-level, max-level, rarity, seller and left. Each is a predicate over a
-- row buy.ReadPage has already built, so every one of them is exercised
-- through the real compile path -- buy.ParseTerm -> buy.CompileTerm -> the
-- filter closure -- rather than by calling an internal.
--
-- WHAT THIS SUITE IS REALLY FOR. Two of these can fail to ANSWER: `owner` is
-- nil until the client resolves the name (CLAUDE.md rule 8) and `timeLeft` is
-- guarded because a server may not report it. A filter that throws those rows
-- away in silence is indistinguishable from a broken filter -- which is
-- exactly how bare `stack` was reported -- so "counted and confessed" is
-- asserted here as hard as the matching itself.
