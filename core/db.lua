-- Aegis: Exchange
-- core/db.lua
--
-- SavedVariables price database, modeled on aux-addon's historical-value
-- scheme: per item we keep a daily MINIMUM unit buyout, and derive market
-- value as a time-weighted median of the last ~30 daily values.
--
-- Declared in Aegis_Exchange.toc:
--   AegisExchangeDB      -- account-wide. Turtle's AH is CROSS-FACTION (one
--                           shared economy), so prices are NOT split by
--                           faction.
--   AegisExchangeCharDB  -- per-character. UI state, last scan info.
--
-- On-disk shape (kept compact — a 50+ page scan touches thousands of items):
--   AegisExchangeDB.realms[realmName].items[itemID] = {
--       daily = { [dayNumber] = minUnitBuyout },   -- pruned to KEEP_DAYS
--       seen  = count,                             -- auctions ever recorded
--   }
--   AegisExchangeDB.vendors[itemID] = sellPrice    -- per unit, when known
--   AegisExchangeDB.names[itemName] = itemID       -- for link-less tooltips
--                                                  -- (mail inbox on 1.12)
--
-- WHY PRICES ARE KEYED BY REALM. `## SavedVariables` is account-wide across
-- every realm, so before v3 a character on Octo WoW and one on Capy WoW folded
-- their buyouts into the SAME daily minimum — two unrelated economies blended
-- into one median. Turtle's AH being cross-faction (a CLAUDE.md hard rule)
-- means there is no FACTION split to make, but there is very much a REALM one.
-- So market data hangs off `realms[realmName]`, while everything that is a
-- game constant rather than an economy fact stays account-wide and shared:
--   * vendors -- an NPC's sell price is identical on every realm; siloing it
--                per realm would make you re-learn it server by server.
--   * names   -- itemName -> itemID is a property of the game, not the market.
--   * shopping / crafting / settings / ledger / vendorMarks -- user data that
--                should follow you everywhere.
--
-- IMPORTANT: both globals are nil until ADDON_LOADED fires for
-- "Aegis_Exchange". db.Init is queued via A.OnLoad and runs exactly then.

-- Bump when the on-disk shape changes so we can migrate old data.
--   v2 -> v3: price data moved from a single account-wide `items` table to
--             `realms[realmName].items`, and vendor prices moved out to their
--             own account-wide `vendors` table. See MigrateToRealms.

-- Daily entries retained per item; also the window MarketValue medians over.
--
-- These two were audited against their stated intent — "recent days weighted
-- more, decreasing effect past roughly a month" — and neither half held. The
-- window was 11 days, so nothing survived to a month for its effect to
-- decrease; and at 0.95 per day the oldest retained value still carried 57% of
-- today's weight, which made the "time-weighted" median return the same answer
-- as an UNWEIGHTED one in 93% of cases. It was a flat 11-day median wearing a
-- decay curve's name.
--
-- 30 days at 0.85 was picked because it costs nothing to get:
--
--   age       today    3d    7d   14d   21d   30d
--   weight     100%   61%   32%   10%    3%    1%
--
--   * a step change (100 -> 200 and stays there) is tracked in 5 days —
--     IDENTICAL to the old setting, so nothing got less responsive in trade;
--   * the weighting now changes the answer in 88% of cases instead of 7%;
--   * outlier rejection is untouched — one day at 5c, or at 50x, still moves a
--     steady series by nothing, which is the whole reason this is a median;
--   * and it fixes casual scanning. In an 11-day window someone scanning weekly
--     had ONE sample, and a weighted median of one sample is just that sample.
--     Thirty days gives them four.
--
-- Existing databases hold at most 11 days, so they ramp up to the new window
-- over the following three weeks rather than changing under anyone at once.

-- GetItemInfo, which answers ONLY for items already in the client's local
-- cache -- so the disenchant line, and the disenchant search filters, go blank
-- for every auction row whose item the client has not happened to see.
--
-- The client's cache is also not ours: it is evicted, it varies by machine, and
-- a fresh install starts empty. Copying what it knows into SavedVariables as we
-- go turns coverage from a snapshot into a curve that only ever grows.
--
-- WHY THE SWEEP IS SAFE, which is the part worth reading before editing it.
-- GetItemInfo for an item the client has NOT cached returns nil and does
-- nothing else -- it does not ask the server. The call that DOES force a fetch
-- is a tooltip SetHyperlink, which is why aux, whose design this follows, uses
-- GetItemInfo as the probe and SetHyperlink only in a separate, explicit,
-- opt-in command. We do not have that command and are not adding one: a sweep
-- that fetches would be thousands of server round trips.
--
-- (An earlier release of this addon asserted the opposite -- that GetItemInfo
-- queries the server -- and shipped a throttle for it. That was wrong, and the
-- correction matters here more than anywhere: it is the difference between
-- this sweep being free and being unshippable.)
