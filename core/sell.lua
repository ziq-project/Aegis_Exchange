-- Aegis: Exchange
-- core/sell.lua
--
-- Posting engine: wraps the 1.12 create-auction API (each call verified against
-- the Turtle UI source) and layers Aegis price context + Turtle specifics on
-- top. The UI lives in ui/frame.lua's Sell tab, exactly as the scanner engine
-- (core/scan.lua) is driven from the Scan tab.
--
-- 1.12 API used here (all globals, valid while the AH SESSION is open —
-- independent of whether the Blizzard AuctionFrame is shown):
--   ClickAuctionSellItemButton()       -- move the cursor item into the sell slot
--   GetAuctionSellItemInfo()           -> name, texture, count, quality, canUse,
--                                         price, maxStack, link   (8 values)
--   CalculateAuctionDeposit(minutes)   -- client deposit math for the slot item
--   StartAuction(minBid, buyout, mins) -- COPPER for the WHOLE stack in the slot;
--                                         mins is 120 / 480 / 1440
--   GetNumAuctionItems("owner")        -> batch, total (total = your auctions)
--
-- Turtle specifics (CLAUDE.md): durations are x3, so 120/480/1440 minutes are
-- really 6h / 24h / 72h; 120-auction account cap; 5% consignment cut on sales;
-- and the shown deposit is inflated -- we scale it by ~0.6 and ALWAYS label it
-- "approx", never exact.

local A = AegisExchange
A.sell = {}

-- THE VANILLA DEPOSIT FORMULA, which is not a guess:
--
--   floor(vendorUnit * rate * stackSize) * stackCount * (minutes / 120)
--
-- `rate` is 5% at your own faction's auction house and 25% at a neutral one --
-- the neutral penalty, which this addon ignored entirely until now and which
-- makes a real difference to whether a posting is worth it. `minutes / 120`
-- turns the duration into units of two hours: 1, 4, 12 in vanilla.
--
-- This replaces a home-grown 2.5% plus a stack-size fudge that appeared in no
-- client and matched nothing. aux uses the formula above, and it is what the
-- vanilla client's own CalculateAuctionDeposit computes.

--

-- watch below), and falls back to this only until the player has posted
-- something. Do not tune the constant -- post an auction and let it learn.

-- for a 2s50c vendor item at 480 minutes the client said 25 and the vanilla

-- about what the server charges -- it is our arithmetic being wrong for this
-- server. The slot could ask the client directly and the bag preview could

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--

--
-- It is worth keeping because it is the one vendor-price source that costs the
-- player nothing. Learning at a merchant needs them to walk to a merchant with
-- the item in their bags; ClassicAPI needs a DLL. This needs them to do the
-- thing they already opened the auction house to do. Every item anyone ever
-- posts teaches its exact vendor price.
--
-- CHARGE ITEMS ARE THE KNOWN INEXACTNESS. On 1.12 the client reports the
-- FULL-charge price here, so a partly-used charge item resolves high. There is
-- no charge count in this API to divide by -- aux carries the same exposure and

-- dropped over a narrow case. A merchant-learned price for the same item
-- overwrites it, and that one is exact.
