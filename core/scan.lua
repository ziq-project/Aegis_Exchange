-- Page-by-page auction scanner for the 1.12 client. Coroutine-free: a hidden
-- OnUpdate driver frame accumulates elapsed time (the global arg1) and only
-- sends the next QueryAuctionItems when the inter-page throttle has passed
-- AND CanSendAuctionQuery() says the client is ready.
--
-- 1.12 rules honored here (see CLAUDE.md):
--   * QueryAuctionItems(name, minLevel, maxLevel, invTypeIndex, classIndex,
--         subclassIndex, page, isUsable, qualityIndex) — 9 args, page is
--         0-indexed, no getAll.
--   * Poll CanSendAuctionQuery() before EVERY query; ~4s between pages.
--   * Wait for AUCTION_ITEM_LIST_UPDATE before reading a page. Page size 50.
--   * GetAuctionItemInfo("list", i) returns exactly 12 values; `owner` may be
--     nil until it resolves — we never wait for owners while price scanning.

scan.PAGE_SIZE = 50

-- Seconds to wait between page queries (on top of CanSendAuctionQuery).
--
-- The REAL throttle is the client's own CanSendAuctionQuery() gate: vanilla
-- keeps it shut for ~5s after each query. This wall-clock delay is a floor we
-- add on top of it.
--
-- AuctionQueryThrottle (https://github.com/brues-code/AuctionQueryThrottle) is
-- a DLL -- not an addon, so there is nothing to IsAddOnLoaded() -- that clears
-- that timer as soon as the server's reply lands. With it installed the gate
-- opens almost immediately, so a 4s floor would throw the benefit away.
--
-- So in "auto" (the default) we drop the floor to FAST_DELAY and let the
-- CLIENT'S GATE do the throttling. That is correct either way:
--   * DLL present  -> gate opens at round-trip speed -> we scan fast.
--   * DLL absent   -> gate stays shut ~5s -> we wait exactly as before.
-- No detection needed; the gate IS the detector. "safe" restores the old
-- fixed floor for anyone whose client reports the gate unreliably.

-- it small -- at 0.25s a 60-page scan spent 15s doing nothing but waiting on us.

-- fed to the price DB. `owner` may be nil until it resolves; we never wait.
--
-- If the current run supplied an `onListing` callback (the Sell tab uses this
-- to collect every listing of one item), it is invoked for EACH auction on the
-- page as onListing(itemId, name, count, buyout, minBid, owner) — including
-- bid-only ones, so the listings table can show them too.
-- `ours` SEPARATES THE TWO JOBS, and mixing them up is what froze clients.
-- Feeding the price DB from any page anyone looks at is deliberate. Handing
-- that page to a SCAN's callback is not: the callback belongs to one run
-- collecting one item, and a page the run did not ask for is somebody else's
-- page -- a Buy-tab search, the stock auction house, a manual browse.
--
-- Before this, every list update in the session was delivered to whichever
-- onListing was installed last, for as long as the client stayed up. The Sell
-- tab's collector went on appending rows for its item and nothing ever emptied
-- it, so sorting and copying that table came to take seconds. See the note
